## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
```{r}
credits <- read.csv(file = "credit.csv")
credits$period <- 492:1
credits <- tsibble(credits, index = period)


credits <- credits %>% 
  mutate(diff_series = difference(credit_in_millions))
autoplot(credits)
```


```{r}
train_df <- head(credits, nrow(credits) - 12)
test_df <- tail(credits, 12)
```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
fit <- train_df %>% 
  stretch_tsibble(.step = 24, .init = 48) %>% 
  model(
    arima210 = ARIMA(credit_in_millions ~ pdq(2, 1, 0) + PDQ(0, 1, 1)), 
    arima013 = ARIMA(credit_in_millions ~ pdq(0, 1, 3) + PDQ(0, 1, 1)),
    arima011 = ARIMA(credit_in_millions ~ pdq(0, 1, 1) + PDQ(0, 1, 1))
  )


fit %>% 
  forecast(h = 12) %>% 
  accuracy(train_df) %>% 
  arrange(RMSE)

fit <- train_df %>% 
  model(arima013 = ARIMA(credit_in_millions ~ pdq(0, 1, 3) + PDQ(0, 1, 1))) #change to best rmse

report(fit)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

fit %>%
  select(arima013) %>%
  gg_tsresiduals(lag = 48)


#for select put your best model

forecast(fit, h = 12) %>%
  filter(.model == 'arima013') %>%
  autoplot(train_df)
#.model == your best model
pred <- fit %>%
  forecast(train_df)
pred <- pred$.mean

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
